## Tomb Raider Underworld - No Spiders or Sharks

This mod uses the existing enemy scanning logic built into
[TheIndra55's Menu Hook](https://github.com/TheIndra55/TRLAU-menu-hook)
to automatically remove spiders and sharks from the game.

Mainly tested on sharks because they are in the first level
(and so I wouldn't run the risk of encountering a spider each
failed attempt lol) but I know a lot of people have a fear
of them too. Can theoretically remove any enemy using their name.

## IMPORTANT

You **must** install
[`binkw32.dll`](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/download/Win32-latest/binkw32-Win32.zip)

This was entirely vibe-coded using Gemini because
I wanted to finally play Underworld lol.

be verified in the menu hooks built-in instances menu)
