Simply uses the existing scanning logic built into the Menu Hook to automatically remove sharks and spiders. Could theoretically be used to remove any enemy that scares the player. Mainly tested on sharks because they are in the first level and then I wouldn't run the risk of encountering a spider each failed attempt lol

Includes a console to verify (can also be verified in the menu hooks built-in instances menu)
